					<Text>
						Client-side mods/resource packs should not give play advantages over
						using plain vanilla Minecraft. If a mod gives a slight play
						advantage, those features are discouraged and I would encourage
						turning those specific options off (for example, minimap mods
						usually show nearby players and mobs and some inventory management
						mods automatically replace armor and totems of undying as it
						breaks).

						Bugs/exploits which allow seeing through normally opaque blocks,

						bug may seem cheaty, ask me about it before using it.

					<Text>
						If rules are broken, they will be encouraged to try reconciling the
						issue with each other first. If the issue isnâ€™t resolved, then I
						will act as arbiter if possible before giving punishments. Taden
						defaults as arbiter if needed if an issue arises between me and
						another player that we cannot resolve on our own.
