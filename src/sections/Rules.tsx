			<TitledSubSection header="Client-side mods/resource packs">
				<Text>
					Client-side mods/resource packs should not give play advantages over
					using plain vanilla Minecraft. If a mod gives a slight play advantage,
					those features are discouraged and I would encourage turning those
					specific options off (for example, minimap mods usually show nearby
					players and mobs and some inventory management mods automatically
					replace armor and totems of undying as it breaks).

			<TitledSubSection header="Bugs/exploits">
				<Text>
					Bugs/exploits which allow seeing through normally opaque blocks,
					duplicating items/blocks/entities, etc. are not allowed. Bugs allowing
					faster clicking speeds and breaking bedrock are fine. If a bug may
					seem cheaty, ask me about it before using it.

			<TitledSubSection header="If rules are broken">
				<Text>
					If rules are broken, they will be encouraged to try reconciling the
					issue with each other first. If the issue isnâ€™t resolved, then I will
					act as arbiter if possible before giving punishments. Taden defaults
					as arbiter if needed if an issue arises between me and another player
					that we cannot resolve on our own.
